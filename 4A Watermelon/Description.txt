Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 ≤ w ≤ 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.


Basically the Yes come out only when the number is divisible by 2 and greater than 2
__> Logic:

every even number greater than 2 is divisible into even pieces
